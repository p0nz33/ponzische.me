            To celebrate the life of Charles Ponzi, the great master of money 
            making schemes, I have created this limited collection of 1882 Ponzee Pyramid NFTs, each one named after 
            notorious con artists throughout the history. Each Ponzee Pyramid costs 0.0666 ETH to mint and launch date 
            is 31st of October. 6 Ponzee Pyramids have been reserved for community distribution.

            If this project flops and you end up hodling a worthless piece of art you can potentially write it off
            as a tax loss:<br>

            "NFTs that become worthless. If an NFT becomes worthless in the hands of its owner who purchased it as 
            an item of personal consumption (akin to purchased artwork that hangs in the personâ€™s den), Sec. 165(c) 
            would preclude a deduction related to this loss. On the other hand, in a trade or business context, if 
            a taxpayer owns an NFT that becomes worthless, the taxpayer should be able to take a deduction for the 
            worthless asset under Sec. 197, subject to the special rules of Sec. 197(f) and Regs. Sec. 1.197-2(g)(1)(i)."

          Roadmap:
          <ul class=p2_style>
            <li>Release Ponzee Pyramids for minting on 31st of October</li>
            <li>Freebies to Ponzee Pyramid minters<br>
              <ul>
                <li>300+ sold - This is incredible, thanks for you support. A Ponzi badge will be dropped for all Ponzee Pyramid holders<br></li>
                <li>1000+ sold - I'll work on a new collection of Ponzee Pyramids with the style choice of the community (free minting for Ponzee Pyramid original minters)<br></li>
                <li>Sold out - I'll dox myself, plus I promise I will continue to work on other NFT projects and every original Ponzee Pyramid minter will 
                  be allowed to mint any of my collections going forward for free</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If this project goes well I will be working on other Solidity projects non-NFT related which I have in mind. If you know how to code and would like to join this
              one man team, then let me know!</li>
          </ul>
