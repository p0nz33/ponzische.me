            To celebrate the life of Charles Ponzi, the great master of money 
            making schemes, I have created this limited collection of 1882 pyramid NFTs, each one named after 
            notorious con artists throughout the history. Each Ponzee Pyramid costs 0.0666 ETH to mint and launch date 
            is 31st of October. 6 Ponzee Pyramids have been reserved for community distribution.

            If this project flops and you end up hodling a worthless piece of art you can potentially write it off
            as a tax loss:<br>

            "NFTs that become worthless. If an NFT becomes worthless in the hands of its owner who purchased it as 
            an item of personal consumption (akin to purchased artwork that hangs in the personâ€™s den), Sec. 165(c) 
            would preclude a deduction related to this loss. On the other hand, in a trade or business context, if 
            a taxpayer owns an NFT that becomes worthless, the taxpayer should be able to take a deduction for the 
            worthless asset under Sec. 197, subject to the special rules of Sec. 197(f) and Regs. Sec. 1.197-2(g)(1)(i)."
